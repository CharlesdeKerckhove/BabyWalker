<h3 id = "AboutText">Everybody needs a break from the demands of new babies and the stresses of daily living,  mums and dads are no exception!<br><br>
One of the biggest factors leading to tension and issues in relationships after childbirth is tiredness. Lack of sleep can have a huge impact on day-to-day life, so think of this service as self-preservation.<br><br>
Giving yourself permission to slow down and relax for a few moments a day, or a few hours each week will help you to reflect and gain a fresh outlook.<br><br>
The purpose of this Baby Walking service is to give new parents 30 – 60 minutes of “me time” to go to the gym, have a power nap, have a bubble bath, go shopping, get a pedicure or simply do nothing (Yes, you are allowed!)</h3>
